### About me: ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, I'm Davide. I am a data scientist, aspiring ML engineer and former theoretical physicist. I currently work in the fraud intelligence team at Nexi (nexi.it), where I try to discover new fraudulent patterns in online transactions through SAS (and hopefully python in the future) processes.
