### About me: ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, I'm Davide. I am a data scientist, aspiring ML engineer and former theoretical physicist. I currently work in the fraud intelligence team at Nexi (nexi.it), where I try to discover new fraudulent patterns in online transactions through SAS (and hopefully python in the future) processes.

### Projects: ðŸ‘¯
I am a python enthusiast with good knowledge in ML and deep learning, particularly in NLP foundations. I am trying to find my way through open source projects, therefore I am open to new contributions in the field.

### Where to find me: ðŸ“«
